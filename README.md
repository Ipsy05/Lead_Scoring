# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem statement:
X Education is an online education company targeting industry professionals. They attract potential customers through various marketing channels and collect leads via website forms and referrals. However, their lead conversion rate is low, with only 30% of leads being converted. To improve efficiency, the company wants to identify "Hot Leads" with the highest conversion potential. By focusing their efforts on these leads, the conversion rate is expected to increase. The task at hand is to build a lead scoring model that assigns scores to leads, enabling the sales team to prioritize high-scoring leads. The CEO aims for a target lead conversion rate of approximately 80%.

## Business Goal:
The provided dataset contains approximately 9000 data points, including attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable is 'Converted,' indicating whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). Categorical variables may have a level called 'Select,' which is equivalent to a null value. The case study aims to construct a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100. This score will help the company target potential leads effectively, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of conversion. The model should also accommodate future changes in the company's requirements and handle additional problems as needed.

## Steps to be followed:
 1. Load necessary libraries
 2. Reading and understanding the dataset
 3. Clean and drop unnecessary columns
 4. Imputing, caping variables wherever necessary
 5. Visualization
 6. Preparing dataset, creating dummies, converting yes/no
 7. Splitting data into train-test
 8. Model building
 9. Evaluating the model
 10. Lead Scoring
